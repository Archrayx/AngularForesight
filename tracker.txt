build a way to update and delete entries that match(possibly use foreign keys), side note, entries will probably not be deleted, so only need to work on update feature


Places where model property names must be changed to match dbcontext property - services formcontrol, add-item.html - done
put search form in side nav - deprecated(it is on top of the table headers)

side nav have dropdowns for search properties. - deprecated
will implement an add table to search feature in side nav to mult table filter
new generated table will be store in an object to encapsulate its filtering
it will probably need to be done in the parent component(app.component) with an incremental property(as remove table button)
